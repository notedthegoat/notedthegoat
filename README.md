- 👋 Hi, I’m @notedthegoat
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, gaming, and everything tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code. I'm still a beginner, but I'm practicing every day. I know a bit of Python and I'm excited to learn more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any beginner-friendly coding projects. I'd love to learn from others and work together to build cool stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can DM me here on GitHub.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m really into English! I've scored perfect marks in TOEIC, TOEIC Speaking, and TOEIC Writing, earning the YBM TOEIC Grand Slammer Master title. I also got a Superior grade in the OPI English test. But, when it comes to coding, I’m just starting out. Let’s learn together!
